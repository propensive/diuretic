# Diuretic

__Simple typeclass instances for integration with the Java Standard Library__

_Diuretic_ provides typeclass instances for
[Anticipation](https://github.com/propensive/anticipation/) typeclasses for the
Java Standard Library. Many of these types have better alternatives in the
[Scala One](https://github.com/propensive/one/) ecosystem, but there are times
when it is necessary to work with types from the Java Standard Library.

## Features

- provides typeclasses for working with time, filesystem objects and URLs
- implementations for `java.time.Instant` & `java.util` time types, `java.io` &
  `java.nio` filesystem types, and `java.net.URL`
- enables Java URLs to be used with the
  [Telekinesis](https://github.com/propensive/telekinesis/) HTTP client
- enables numerous projects like
  [Surveillance](https://github.com/propensive/surveillance/) to work with Java
IO and NIO types like `File` and `Path`
- allows numerous projects to use `java.time` or `java.util` types
- integration with other libraries that use
  [Anticipation](https://github.com/propensive/anticipation/) is seamless


## Availability

Diuretic has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

Using Diuretic is usually as simple as adding an import, alongside another
project which implements
[Anticipation](https://github.com/propensive/anticipation/) typeclasses.
Currently six contextual imports are available for three different Anticipation
modules.

### Time Representation

Diuretic provides a choice of three different representations of durations and instants:

- `timeApi.javaTime`—uses `java.time.Instant` for instants and
  `Long` for durations
- `timeApi.javaLongTime`—uses `Long` for both instants and durations
- `timeApi.javaUtil`—uses `java.util.Date` for instants and `Long`
  for durations

### File Representation

Diuretic provides a choice of two different file representations:

- `fileApi.javaNio`—uses `java.nio.file.Path` for files, directories and paths
- `fileApi.javaIo`—uses `java.io.File` for files, directories and paths

A possible future version may offer representations which use distinct types
for paths (which may not relate to a file or directory) and files/directories.

### URL Representation

- `urlApi.javaNet`—uses `java.net.URL` for URLs



## Status

Diuretic is classified as __embryotic__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Diuretic is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 72 lines of code.

## Building

Diuretic can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Diuretic are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/diuretic/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Diuretic easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Author

Diuretic was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from
[Propensive O&Uuml;](https://propensive.com/).



## Name

The name _Diuretic_ alludes to a side-effect of drinking coffee, or in our case, Java.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meanings—since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
