## Status

Diuretic is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Diuretic is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 61 lines of code.

## Building

Diuretic can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.
