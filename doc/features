- provides typeclasses for working with time, filesystem objects and URLs
- implementations for `java.time.Instant` & `java.util` time types, `java.io` &
  `java.nio` filesystem types, and `java.net.URL`
- enables Java URLs to be used with the [Telekinesis](/propensive/telekinesis/)
  HTTP client
- enables numerous projects like [Surveillance](/propensive/surveillance/) to
  work with Java IO and NIO types like `File` and `Path`
- allows numerous projects to use `java.time` or `java.util` types
- integration with other libraries that use
  [Anticipation](/propensive/anticipation/) is seamless
